Each time you install a package, apt will ask for permission to acquire the disk space needed to install the package.


Use the man pages to find the flag that lets you automatically answer yes to any prompts that come up when installing a package:


Run man apt


The flag is sudo apt -y install <package name>.




To install the remaining packages, run the following commands:


sudo apt -y install cowsay


sudo apt -y install fortune




Next we will want to use our new packages. Use the following commands to run your new utilities:


emacs will open your new text editor.

cowsay hello will start a new line with a cow saying "hello."

fortune will give you a new and interesting proverb for the day.



Bonus


Is there a way to install multiple packages with a single command?


Yes. Include each package name in the command, separated by a space:
sudo apt -y install emacs cowsay fortune




Combine the cowsay and fortune utility by running the following command:

fortune | cowsay
