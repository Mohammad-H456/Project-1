Create a research directory in your home folder.

Run cd /home/sysadmin/.
Run mkdir research.



Access the /var/log directory; check to see if the auth.log exists, as you need this to check for suspicious logins.

Run ls /var/log/auth.log

This will confirm the file exists.



Access your personal home directory; check to see if you have a Desktop and Downloads directory.

Run ls /home/sysadmin/.
The Desktop and Downloads directories will appear.



Access the binary directory; check to see if you can find cat and ps binary files.

Run ls /bin/cat.
Run ls /bin/ps.
This will confirm the files exist.



Check to see if there are any scripts in temporary directories, as those may be suspicious.

Run ls /tmp.
This directory contains a shell script called str.sh. This file is out of place, and should be noted for later analysis.



Check that the only users with accounts in the /home directory are adam, billy, instructor, jane, john max, sally, student, sysadmin and vagrant. There should not be additional directories. Note any other users that you see.

Run ls /home.
This revealed home folders named jack and http.
